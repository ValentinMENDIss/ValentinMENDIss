# About me:

I'm Valentin Virstiuc, a passionate programmer and tech enthusiast with a love for exploring the world of computing.
When I'm not tinkering with my PC (old or new, it's all good!), you can find me diving into the wonderful worlds
of Linux, BSD, and servers.

My GitHub page is where I share my coding adventures in Shell (Bash), Python (with a focus on small game
development), and C programming. You might find interesting projects like my fetch program, which helps you
discover your system's hardware details and RAM usage.

As an enthusiast of cyber-security, I occasionally experiment with security-related topics (though I acknowledge I
haven't dived deep into this area... yet!). Nevertheless, my passion for learning and sharing knowledge drives me
to contribute to the community through code.

**About my projects:**

On this page, you'll find a collection of scripts, tools, and games that I've created while exploring programming
languages like Bash, Python, and C. Feel free to explore, learn from, or even contribute to these projects!

**What I'm all about:**

* Programming with passion
* Exploring Linux, BSD, and servers
* Learning and sharing knowledge
* Tinkering with PC hardware (old and new!)
* Experimenting with cyber-security (in a beginner's capacity)
